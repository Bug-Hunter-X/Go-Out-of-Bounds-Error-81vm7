This repository demonstrates a common Go error: an out-of-bounds array access.  The `bug.go` file contains a function with a for loop that iterates one element past the end of the array, resulting in a runtime panic.  The `bugSolution.go` file shows the corrected code.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop conditions when working with arrays and slices in Go.
